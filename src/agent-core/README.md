# Agent Core

The autonomous reasoning engine for Strada.Brain. Provides environment observation, task-aware multi-provider routing, confidence-based consensus, and proactive agent behavior.

## Key Components

### AgentCore
Runs as part of HeartbeatLoop.tick(). Each tick: collect observations → score priorities → LLM reasoning → act or wait. Protected by tickInFlight guard, 30s rate limit, budget floor (10%), and priority threshold (30).

### ObservationEngine
Collects from registered observers, deduplicates within 60s window, maintains history (100 entries max). Priority-sorted output.

### ProviderRouter
Scores available providers against task classification using configurable preset weights plus learned control-plane signals. Preset workload weights (`cost`, `capability`, `speed`, `diversity`) are now combined with runtime phase telemetry, explicit phase-local verdict scores, verifier cleanliness, rollback pressure, retry cost, provider-catalog freshness, official alignment, and persisted execution replay signals. Terminal replay bias also blends the strongest available trajectory verdict, preferring trusted judge types before recency, so a later weak review can down-weight a branch that only looked successful in its original runtime window without punishing earlier non-terminal phases. Supports PAOR phase switching, so planning, execution, clarification-review, review, and synthesis can favor different workers without provider-specific hardcoding.
These routing decisions are internal worker assignments only. The user still talks only to Strada; provider traces and phase outcomes are evidence of the control plane, not a direct chat identity switch.

### ConsensusManager
When ConfidenceEstimator scores output below threshold, ConsensusManager verifies with a second provider. Strategies: "review" (ask if correct) or "re-execute" (same prompt to different provider). Graceful degradation: 1 provider = skip entirely.

## Configuration

| Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `ROUTING_PRESET` | `balanced` | budget / balanced / performance |
| `ROUTING_PHASE_SWITCHING` | `true` | Different providers per PAOR phase |
| `CONSENSUS_MODE` | `auto` | auto / critical-only / always / disabled |
| `CONSENSUS_THRESHOLD` | `0.5` | Confidence below this triggers consensus |
| `CONSENSUS_MAX_PROVIDERS` | `3` | Max providers consulted per decision |

## Tests

```bash
npx vitest run src/agent-core/            # All agent-core tests
npx vitest run src/agent-core/routing/    # Routing tests only
npx vitest run src/agent-core/observers/  # Observer tests only
```
